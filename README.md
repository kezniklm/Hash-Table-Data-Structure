## Description
This is a C implementation of a hash table data structure. It provides efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval using a hash function and an array.

## Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command:
```bash
$ make
```

## Usage - Wordcount
To run the program that is using static libraries:
```bash
$ ./wordcount <input>
```
To run the program that is using static libraries:
```bash
$ ./wordcount-dynamic <input>
```
where input is stdin or file

## Usage - Tail
To run the program:
```bash
$ ./tail <input>
```
where input is stdin or file
